# Atomic Monokai theme
#### A Monokai inspired syntax-highlighting theme for Atom
<br>
  As a long-time Sublime Text user, I've recently transitioned to using Atom as my my go-to code editor, and while I enjoy many of it's more *hackable* aspects, I had been unable to find a syntax theme that felt familiar amongst the available prospects.

*Keep in mind, this is my first attempt at creating a syntax theme for Atom, so if there are any issues please feel free to let me know and I'll do my best to fix them.*
